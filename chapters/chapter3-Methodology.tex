\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chap:meth}

This chapter starts with the analysis of requirements for the implemented
software. In the second section of the chapter I will discuss possible
approaches to adapt an external state machine to Phantom OS persistency model.
The last section describes the implementation and design decisions in detail.

\section {Requirements analysis}
\label{sec:meth:req}

As previous chapters of this paper suggest, the goal of this paper is to create
an implementation of a TCP suitable for a persistent system. More precisely, I
target a port of Phantom OS to Genode OS framework. This section contains a
list of requirements that I will follow while designing my own protocol
implementation.

\subsection {Transparency for client applications}
Persistent support systems (PSSs) aim to make development of applications
easier. The PSSs provide their clients with an abstraction of an uninterrupted
execuiton. In a real world, however, a computer system may experience
downtimes. The point of a PSS is to hide these downtimes from applications that
use it. Such hiding of undesired effects is generally called
\textit{transparency}.

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:int:phantom}, the current implementation of
networking stack is not transparent for the applications residing in PVM.
Application designers should foresee existence of these errors and write
handlers for them. To make PoG port really orthogonally persistent these errors
should be hadled at PSS level, not by clients.

That means that the state of TCP connections should be the same before a
shutdown and after a reboot. To achieve that a persistent TCP implementation
should either (1) backup and restore connections state or (2) make the
disappearance of a remote peer invisible for application on the other end of
the connection. Of course, restoration of the state should be done before
returning control to applications.

(1) can be achieved with reestablishing connections on startup. However, the
remote peer should be ready to the reestablishment request. This is problematic
in case when a persistent host plays role of a server in a client-server
communication. (2) can be achieved with use of an message broker that will
mimic an alive host with full TCP input queue. Thus it will keep the connection
alive but prohibit sending packets to the channel. Another way to achieve (2)
is to send a control message to the remote socket. The remote TCP in this case
should efficiently do the same thing as a message broker did. It should mimic
live connection that cannot accept data. The drawback of this approach is that
to exchange control messages both communicating peer should have enhanced TCP
stack.

\subsection {Robustness to rollbacks}

Phantom OS uses full-memory snapshots of PVM memory space to provide
persistence for its clients. Snapshots are taken in a live mode so that
processes inside the VM continue to run. Due to the two previous facts,
computational operations of PVM applications can be executed more than once.
For example, assume that an application receives packets A, B, and C.  Assume
that after packet A is received, snapshot is performed. While it was on
progress, the application receives packet B. After the snapshot was made,
applications receives packet C and immediately after this machine goes down.
After the snapshot would be restored the application will have no knowledge
that it already received packets B and C. Thus the application will send ACK
packet for A, which will result in error because the remote peer does not
expect this ACK. Moreover, it is unable to retransmit this packet, since it is
not exist in remote TCP's retransmission queue, because it was already
acknowledged when the application received B and C.

Phantom OS snapshot mechanism takes into account that snapshot is not a atomic
process. Thus, in usual case it would handle reception of packet B properly,
i.e. the client application would know that B was received. But in case of 
PoG the TCP stack is not stateless like Phantom kernel but still transient.
Therefore, if TCP receives a packet but does not passes it to the application
before restart, this packet may be lost. The remote peer expects that the
application processed it but the application never received it because TCP did
not finish delivering it to the application.

Three solutions exist that may solve the problem above. The first is to refrain
from sending acknowledgment packets if a received packet is not included in any
snapshot. However, this will either dramatically increase the number of
retransmissions in a network, which will result in reduced network performance
or it will require doing snapshots very often. In such case a snapshot should
be performed each 50ms to avoid extra network congestion at all. However, in
PoG a snapshot runs for around 10 seconds. This approach is not acceptable with
such a long snapshot.  

The second solution is to keep in persistent memory a buffer that will store
all packets that TCP clients had not consumed yet. In this case persistent
memory can be a regular file or snapshotted memory space. 

The third approach is to have a message broker inside a network that will
function similarly to the buffer in the second approach. The broker can save
all acknowledged packets in a network, and flush its queue when it detects that
receiving host has done a snapshot. ICMP messages or some similar stateless
network protocol could be useful to notify the broker about the end of the
snapshot process.

\subsection {Usefullness}

Phantom OS is already capable of restoring sockets in CLOSED and LISTEN states.
For a Genode implementation of a persistent TCP to be useful it should work for
the same or bigger set of states. Even if the developed software will only
support the same set of states the fact that the software is implemented as a
Genode component will greatly improve maintainablility of the software.

\subsection {Compatibility with existing protocols}

The last design goal is not directly related to providing persistent I/O
abstraction to the clients of a network stack. Since snapshotting is a very
popular technique for implementing persistent systems, and Genode is actively
used to develop various operating systems, it is probable that some other
developers might want to use persistent TCP in their software.

That means that result of this work should be a standalone application that
works without Phantom and is flexible enough to support all use cases that may
arise. Fortunately, Genode's component-based architecture helps greatly with
it. Another reason to make persistent TCP implementation a standalone
application is that the PoG port is not yet ready for me to experiment with it.

Another thing that should be addressed in the design of the API of the system,
is easy migration from non-persistent TCP stacks that are already available in
Genode, namely lwip and lxip. To do this I intend to design API very similar to
regular sockets or even exactly the same, but with different call semantics. I
also plan to add a Virtual File System (VFS) plugin that will expose sockets as
regular files because this is the way how Genode developers suggest
integrating sockets into the Genode ecosystem since version 18.11. With such
implementation, even relinking of existing binary will be not needed. The only
thing user would need is to change the configuration of the init Genode
component.

\section{On persisting of finite state machines}
\label{sec:meth:fsms}

Most TCP implementations implement logical state of the sockets as finite state
machines. Since the goal of the paper is to create a persistent TCP
implementation, it might be useful to consider how an arbitrary FSM can be
snapshotted to restore it later to the same state from the snapshot. 

The most straightforward and universal way to achive the desired outcome is to
use a full-memory snapshot of a running process. Full-memory snapshot should
include stack and address space. Also it should include current context, i.e.
general-purpose registers and the program counter. Obtained snapshot should be
stored in a persistent memory and loaded to the apropriate memory on restore.
In principle, this approach would work for any running process. A drawback of
this approach is that an operating system should provide mechanisms to allow
such manipulations with address spaces.

The second approach is to directly access current state of the FSM. Usually FSM
are implemented on C and C++ as structs or classes holding current state as an
value of an enumerable type. If it is possible to access these structures
directly, simple saving and loading them would work. In some cases, for example
sockets, there are several state machines: one per socket. In such cases FSMs
should be registered at the supervisor that controls inputs and stores FSM
structures.

The last approach requires knowing of internal functioning of an FSM. When the
set of all possible states and transitions of FSM is known in advance, it is
possible to implement FSM with the same transitions. When the tracking FSM is
provided with the same inputs as the target one states of both FSMs should be
in sync. Assessing state of the tracking FSM will allow observer to determine
state of the target FSM.  Moreover, tracking of inputs greatly helps in
restoration phase. To restore state of the target FSM it is enough to provide
it with the same inputs once again. This approach is useful when an FSM does
not have a centralized state or when it cannot be easily accessed.
