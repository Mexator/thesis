\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

During this thesis I have described and implemented the PTCP mechanism for
providing an abstraction of persistent TCP sockets for the client applications.
The mechanism was initially intended to be used together with the port of
Phantom OS to Genode OS Framework. However, the mentioned port was not finished
before this work. That is why I narrowed my scope to implement software that
can be used with Genode only. I nevertheless believe that the PTCP can be
easily integrated to the upcoming PoG port. It is used in the same way as any
other Genode TCP stack therefore switching to it should not be a problem.

However, there are still limitations in the current version of the PTCP. It
functionality can be improved, as described in the Chapter \ref{chap:meth}. It
can include support for sockets in established state, as well as handling of
longer shutdowns with some sort of cooperation mechanism.
