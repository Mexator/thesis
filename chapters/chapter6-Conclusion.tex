\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conc}

During this thesis I have described and implemented the PTCP mechanism for
providing an abstraction of persistent TCP sockets for the client applications.
The mechanism was initially intended to be used together with the port of
Phantom OS to Genode OS Framework. However, the mentioned port was not finished
before this work. That is why I narrowed my scope to implement software that
can be used with Genode only. I nevertheless believe that the PTCP can be
easily integrated to the upcoming PoG port. It is used in the same way as any
other Genode TCP stack with minor additions, therefore switching to it should
not be a problem.

However, there are still limitations in the current version of the PTCP. Its
functionality can be improved to meet the requirements for an ideal persistent
TCP stack, as described in the Chapter \ref{chap:meth}. It can include support
for client sockets in the established state, as well as handling of longer
shutdowns with some sort of cooperation mechanism.
